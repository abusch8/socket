1. You are designing a system to securely transmit medical records between healthcare
providers. Write an algorithm using public key cryptography that encrypts the data in transit and ensures its integrity, confidentiality, and non-repudiation to comply with patient privacy regulations. Specify the type of cryptographic primitive to be used for each step of the algorithm, including encryption and integrity checks. Additionally, explain the reason for using each cryptographic primitive. You can use protocol diagrams as discussed in class.
